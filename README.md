My port of Hunt The Wumpus to python3, with some extra additions...

Hunt The Wumpus Kyogre Edition Readme

A CLI based python port of Hunt The Wumpus. Player uses commands to move and shoot their way through a cave to catch the mystical Wumpus.

Basically what it says on the tin. Works in Python 3.x out of the box, as it only uses preinstalled modules.

In releases with an ASCII map, smaller terminal font sizes work better. On a 720p screen, 12pt is reccommended. On 1080p, 14pt. On 4K, 18pt.

You can download Hunt The Wumpus with IPFS. Get IPFS at https://ipfs.io/#install or using snapd, homebrew, or chocolatey
